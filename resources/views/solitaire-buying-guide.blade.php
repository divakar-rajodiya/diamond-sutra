                <h6 class="fw-bold border-bottom mb-2 pb-2">Set Your Budget</h6>
                <p class="mb-2">Determine your budget beforehand to help narrow down your options. Remember that a solitaire's value is influenced by its size, quality, and other characteristics.</p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h6 class="fw-bold border-bottom mb-2 pb-2">Choose Your Diamond Shape</h6>
                <p class="mb-2">Explore different diamond shapes such as round, princess, emerald, cushion, and pear. Select a shape that reflects your personal style and preferences.</p>

                <h6 class="fw-bold border-bottom mb-2 pb-2">Select Carat Weight</h6>
                <p class="mb-2">Decide on the carat weight of your solitaire based on your budget and personal preferences. Keep in mind that carat weight directly influences the size and overall appearance of the diamond. Suggestion: Opt for a diamond weighing 0.8 or 0.9 carats instead of 1 carat. This way, the diamond will appear larger while also allowing you to save some money :)</p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h6 class="fw-bold border-bottom mb-2 pb-2">Prioritize Cut Quality</h6>
                <p class="mb-2">The cut of a diamond greatly affects its brilliance and sparkle. Opt for a diamond with an excellent or very good cut grade for maximum brilliance.</p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h6 class="fw-bold border-bottom mb-2 pb-2">Consider Diamond Colour</h6>
                <p class="mb-2">While diamonds range from colorless to light yellow, subtle color differences can significantly impact the appearance and value of a solitaire. Aim for a near-colorless grade (G to J) for the best balance of quality and value.</p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h6 class="fw-bold border-bottom mb-2 pb-2">Assess Clarity</h6>
                <p class="mb-2">Clarity refers to the presence of internal flaws (inclusions) and surface imperfections (blemishes) in a diamond. Choose a diamond with a clarity grade of VS2 or SI1/SI2 for a balance of quality and value.</p>

            <div class="mb-4">
                <h6 class="fw-bold border-bottom mb-2 pb-2">Choose Your Setting</h6>

            </div>
            <div class="mb-4">
                <h6 class="fw-bold border-bottom mb-2 pb-2">Verify Certification</h6>
                <p class="mb-2">Ensure that your chosen solitaire comes with a reputable diamond certification from a recognized gemological laboratory such as GIA, IGI, or GSI. This certification guarantees the quality and authenticity of your diamond.</p>
